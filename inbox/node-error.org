* 关于 node 错误处理
** try...catch 只会捕获当前事件循环里的异常  
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  //error code
  try {
      run(() => {
          throw new Error();
      });
  } catch (e) {
      console.log(e);
  }
#+END_SRC
** 对于一个给定的函数，如果其中的一个异常是异步传递的，那么所有的异常都需要是异步传递的
** 你即可以同步传递错误（抛出），也可以异步传递错误（通过传给一个回调函数或者触发EventEmitter的 error事件），但是不用同时使用 
** Node 错误对象属性名约定
